In this project, we will clean our data and prepares for data analysis. 
We will be using Singapore NEA Energy Savings | Kaggle data to analyze the total garbage collection and recycling rate. 
The material names are different as these data were collected from different resources. We will be added the latest data
of 2020 waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling from the website so that we can have the latest statics analysis. 
We will be finding how much energy we can produce using Greentumble key information.

We will be using Recycling statistics to calculate energy saved every year from 2003 to 2020 based on five waste types, 
plastics, paper, glass, ferrous and non-ferrous metal.
